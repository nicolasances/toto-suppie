I'm working with ReactJS using Typescript. 

I have the following components available: 

CheckBox: a component displaying a checkbox with the following props (delimited by """): 
    """
    export interface CheckBoxProps {
        onToggleFlag: () => void,
        flag: boolean
        label?: string
    }
    """"

I need you to build a function component called ListItem that follows these specs: 
 - Uses flex-box
 - Displays a box with className "list-item" as large as its container
 - The list-item box needs to contain two elements, horizontally aligned:
   1. a checkbox
   2. a div that will contain a text description, passed in the props of the item

Assume that the icons are provided as react components.
All the css should go in a separate file called ListItem.css.
